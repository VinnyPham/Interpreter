# **Interpreter**

## **Overview**
A custom interpreter program written in C++ for a simple programming language called BORG. This interpreter supports variable declarations, arithmetic operations, and basic control structures â€” all executed from parsed tokens and evaluated using a hash table with chaining for variable storage.

## **Features**
- Parses and executes code written in the BORG language
- Supports integer and float variables
- Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Hash table implementation with chaining for variable management
- Command-by-command execution with error handling
- Stack to hold the scope of variables
